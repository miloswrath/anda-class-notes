# CLASS NOTES FOR ANALYZING DATA FOR INFORMATICS (CS:2420)

***ALL NOTES AND PRACTICE FILES ARE EITHER CREATED OR ENHANCED USING LLM***

## REPO ORGANIZATION

>> M -> Midterm

Every M stands for midterm so all notes are separated by midterm
- e.g. `m1` is everything before midterm 1


>> lec -> Lecture

lec stands for lecture so each lec folder contains resources for each lecture

## MISC INFO

- Each lec folder should have a notes.py, notes.md, and practice.py (if it doesn't sorry)
    - notes.md is any notes that aren't code
    - notes.py is any code notes
    - practice.py is gpt generated practice question
